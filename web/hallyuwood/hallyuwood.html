                circulates around the pathos, the despair, the happy ending, the blossoming
                friendship and the realistic sense of helplessness, without overly emphasising
                any of the topics; it is a well-balanced film."

                person. Detectives look for a witness. A witness, Min Soo-Ah appears,
                but Min Soo-Ah is blind. She used to be a promising student at the police
                academy. With her acute senses, Min Soo-Ah is able to reveal important
                clues on the hit and run case. Another witness, Kwon Gi-Seob then appears.
                Gi-Seob, who witnessed the case with his own eyes, gives contradictory
                statements to Min Soo-Ah. The investigation then goes through many twists
                and turns, while Min Soo-Ah finds herself up against the killer.
